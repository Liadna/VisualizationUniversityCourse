I opened the cmd on the "Recipes_Web_Project" folder.

Used python 2.7 I ran the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" (for python 3 - "python -m http.server").

This will create a local server on the computer.

for the vis (on the browser):
1. http://localhost:8000/index_heat_map.html 
2. http://localhost:8000/index_matrix_combination.html - Taking couple of seconds to be opened

Have A Nice Week,
Liad.
